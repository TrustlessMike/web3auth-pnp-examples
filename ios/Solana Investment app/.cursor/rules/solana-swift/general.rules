// General rules for working with solana-swift package
// Last updated: March 29, 2025

// Rule: Always specify the Solana network explicitly
// Why: Avoids ambiguity between mainnet, devnet, and testnet
When initializing APIEndPoint:
  Suggest: "Use `.mainnetBeta`, `.devnet`, or `.testnet` explicitly instead of relying on defaults."
  Example: "let endpoint = APIEndPoint(address: \"https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com\", network: .mainnetBeta)"

// Rule: Use Swift concurrency (async/await) over closures
// Why: Solana-swift supports modern Swift concurrency since v2.0.0
When calling methods like getBlockHeight or getBalance:
  Suggest: "Prefer `try await` over closure-based calls for better readability and error handling."
  Example: "let balance = try await apiClient.getBalance(account: account)"

// Rule: Check for latest version
// Why: Ensures compatibility with Solana network updates
When importing SolanaSwift:
  Suggest: "Verify you're using the latest version (e.g., 5.0.0 or higher) from https://github.com/p2p-org/solana-swift."
